As a condition of my employment with **[Entity-name]**, its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (together, the "**Company**"), and in consideration of my employment with the Company and my receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid to me by the Company, I agree to the following provisions of this **[Entity-name]** At-Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement (this "**Agreement**"):

## 1. At-Will Employment

I UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY IS FOR NO SPECIFIED TERM AND CONSTITUTES "AT-WILL" EMPLOYMENT. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS UNAUTHORIZED AND NOT VALID UNLESS IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT OR CEO OF **[Entity-name]** ACCORDINGLY, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE OR FOR ANY OR NO CAUSE, AT MY OPTION OR AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY MAY MODIFY JOB TITLES, SALARIES, AND BENEFITS FROM TIME TO TIME AS IT DEEMS NECESSARY.

## 2. Applicability to Past Activities

> A. **[Entity-name]** and I acknowledge that I have been engaged to provide services by **[Entity-name]** for a period of time prior to the date of this Agreement starting on **[Date-prior]** (the "**Prior Engagement Period**"). Accordingly, I agree that if and to the extent that, during the Prior Engagement Period: (i) I received access to any information from or on behalf of Company that would have been "Company Confidential Information" (as defined below) if I received access to such information during the period of my employment with Company under this Agreement; or (ii) I conceived, created, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice any item, including any intellectual property rights with respect thereto, that would have been an "Invention" (as defined below) if conceived, created, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice during the period of my employment with Company under this Agreement; then any such information shall be deemed "Company Confidential Information" hereunder and any such item shall be deemed an "Invention" hereunder, and this Agreement shall apply to such information or item as if conceived, created, authored, invented, developed or reduced to practice under this Agreement.

## 3. Confidentiality

> A. _Definition of Confidential Information_. I understand that "**Company Confidential Information**" means information that the Company has or will develop, acquire, create, compile, discover or own, that has value in or to the Company's business which is not generally known and which the Company wishes to maintain as confidential. Company Confidential Information includes both information disclosed by the Company to me, and information developed or learned by me during the course of my employment with Company. Company Confidential Information also includes all information of which the unauthorized disclosure could be detrimental to the interests of Company, whether or not such information is identified as Company Confidential Information. By example, and without limitation, Company Confidential Information includes any and all non-public information that relates to the actual or anticipated business and/or products, research or development of the Company, or to the Company's technical data, trade secrets, or know-how, including, but not limited to, research, product plans, or other information regarding the Company's products or services and markets therefor, customer lists and customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the Company on which I called or with which I may become acquainted during the term of my employment), software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances, and other business information disclosed by the Company either directly or indirectly in writing, orally or by drawings or inspection of premises, parts, equipment, or other Company property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company Confidential Information shall not include any such information which I can establish (i) was publicly known or made generally available prior to the time of disclosure by Company to me; (ii) becomes publicly known or made generally available after disclosure by Company to me through no wrongful action or omission by me; or (iii) is in my rightful possession, without confidentiality obligations, at the time of disclosure by Company as shown by my then-contemporaneous written records. I understand that nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit employees' rights to discuss the terms, wages, and working conditions of their employment, as protected by applicable law.
>
> B. _Nonuse and Nondisclosure_. I agree that during and after my employment with the Company, I will hold in the strictest confidence, and take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information, and I will not (i) use the Company Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than for the benefit of the Company in the course of my employment, or (ii) disclose the Company Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written authorization of the President, CEO, or the Board of Directors of the Company. Prior to disclosure when compelled by applicable law; I shall provide prior written notice to the President, CEO, and General Counsel of **[Entity-name]** (as applicable). I agree that I obtain no title to any Company Confidential Information, and that as between Company and myself, **[Entity-name]** retains all Confidential Information as the sole property of **[Entity-name]** I understand that my unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Confidential Information during my employment may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination and legal action by the Company. I understand that my obligations under this **Section 3.B** shall continue after termination of my employment.
>
> C. _Former Employer Confidential Information_. I agree that during my employment with the Company, I will not improperly use, disclose, or induce the Company to use any proprietary information or trade secrets of any former employer or other person or entity with which I have an obligation to keep in confidence. I further agree that I will not bring onto the Company's premises or transfer onto the Company's technology systems any unpublished document, proprietary information, or trade secrets belonging to any such third party unless disclosure to, and use by, the Company has been consented to in writing by such third party.
>
> D. _Third Party Information_. I recognize that the Company has received and in the future will receive from third parties associated with the Company, e.g., the Company's customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, partners, or collaborators ("**Associated Third Parties**"), their confidential or proprietary information ("**Associated Third Party Confidential Information**") subject to a duty on the Company's part to maintain the confidentiality of such Associated Third Party Confidential Information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. By way of example, Associated Third Party Confidential Information may include the habits or practices of Associated Third Parties, the technology of Associated Third Parties, requirements of Associated Third Parties, and information related to the business conducted between the Company and such Associated Third Parties. I agree at all times during my employment with the Company and thereafter, that I owe the Company and its Associated Third Parties a duty to hold all such Associated Third Party Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, and not to use it or to disclose it to any person, firm, corporation, or other third party except as necessary in carrying out my work for the Company consistent with the Company's agreement with such Associated Third Parties. I further agree to comply with any and all Company policies and guidelines that may be adopted from time to time regarding Associated Third Parties and Associated Third Party Confidential Information. I understand that my unauthorized use or disclosure of Associated Third Party Confidential Information or violation of any Company policies during my employment may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination and legal action by the Company.

I understand and agree that the decision whether or not to commercialize or market any Inventions is within the Company's sole discretion and for the Company's sole benefit, and that no royalty or other consideration will be due to me as a result of the Company's efforts to commercialize or market any such Inventions.

Furthermore, I represent and warrant that if any Prior Inventions are included on Exhibit A, they will not materially affect my ability to perform all obligations under this Agreement. I will inform **[Entity-name]** in writing before incorporating such Prior Inventions into any Invention or otherwise utilizing such Prior Invention in the course of my employment with the Company, and the Company is hereby granted a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable worldwide license (with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses) to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, sell, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise exploit such Prior Inventions, without restriction, including, without limitation, as part of or in connection with such Invention, and to practice any method related thereto.

To the extent that Moral Rights cannot be assigned under applicable law, I hereby waive and agree not to enforce any and all Moral Rights, including, without limitation, any limitation on subsequent modification, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
>
> D. _Maintenance of Records_. I agree to keep and maintain adequate, current, accurate, and authentic written records of all Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of my employment with the Company.

## Exhibit D

**[Entity-name] CONFLICT OF INTEREST GUIDELINES**

It is the policy of **[Entity-name]** to conduct its affairs in strict compliance with the letter and spirit of the law and to adhere to the highest principles of business ethics. Accordingly, all officers, employees, and independent contractors must avoid activities that are in conflict, or give the appearance of being in conflict, with these principles and with the interests of the Company. The following are potentially compromising situations that must be avoided:
