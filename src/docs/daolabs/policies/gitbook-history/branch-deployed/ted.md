+# Building Community
+
+## 🤝 Movement DAO Community
+
+Movement DAO is designed for expression, empowerment, and engagement. We are keenly focused on empowering communities and encouraging them to consider this powerful new way of solving problems. The Movement DAO creators share the passion and compassion of each of its movement communities and have built an environment dedicated to their collaboration and harmonizing around movements.
+
+## Leadership
+
+Movement Leaders provide an opportunity for movements to increase momentum. Leaders are compensated by movements on a regular basis for promoting the movement to the world. Movement communities will elect these leaders (who are likely individuals with large social followings already) upon the minting of new movements. Leaders are compensated in Movement Tokens that are unlocked if they adequately fulfill the community’s goals. Leader's responsibilities can include promoting their movements, engaging communities, and fostering a collaborative ethos. Initiatives – Initiatives are projects proposed by the movement community. Token holders vote on which initiatives receive funding. Funding is provided by the reserve pool & direct tributes. Funding is distributed incrementally when predetermined milestones are achieved. Initiatives are proposed with those milestones. Funding Initiatives - Each movement is its own DAO that accumulates reserves over time to fund initiatives. . Reserves are funded by a variety of “tribute” (activity based contribution) mechanisms specified by their communities. These can include: Transaction tributes associated with the minting and burning of movement tokens Tributes from selling vested tokens early Direct tributes to initiatives through staking (with boosted voting rights)
+
+Movements are designed to become sustainable communities with continuous funding. However, movements cannot sustain without leadership, coordination and engagement. Below are some key considerations for how communities remain healthy and impactful.&#x20;
+
+## TOKEN GIVEAWAYS
+
+Movement DAO & its Movements can use giveaways to strategically bring new people into their ecosystem. A giveaway has three key phases: The community selects a strategic person who should be financially aligned with the movement. They identify this person via their Twitter account. They decide how many coins to give this person. The individual can then claim up to half their coins. In order to claim tokens they need to nominate via twitter two or more people. The other half of their coins are then distributed to whoever they nominated. A flywheel persists of people claiming coins and nominating other people until the gas fees to claim coins are higher than the value of the coins. After a set amount of time unclaimed coins will go back to the endowment. Communities can also decide to lock their coins or vest their coins in giveaways. Locked coins can’t be sold for a set amount of time. Vested coins incur a tribute on early sale.
+
+{% hint style="warning" %}
+All members should review and adopt Movement DAO [community pledge](../community-pledge).&#x20;
+{% endhint %}

### community/charities.md

```diff
+# Charities
+
+Movement DAO works in harmony with charitable organizations in a variety of ways.&#x20;
+
+* **Charities launching movements** - Charities may decide to launch their own movements to raise money and procure help in this new and exciting way!  Charities can be the recipient of funds through this platform and can offer tokens or NFTs to its community as a reward. Instead of offering t-shirts and prizes like many non-profits do, they can now offer a reward system to incentivize recurring donations from their community (similar to airline miles).&#x20;
+* **Charities as direct investors** – Organizations such as Foundations and Endowments can elect a portion of their investment portfolios to directly invest in Movement Tokens. Instead of their investment portfolios having passive allocations to ESG stocks, they become active voting members of the community.
+* **Charities as beneficiaries** – Charities that join Movement communities can earn token awards from Movement Evangelists by offering their time and expertise in Movement communities&#x20;
```

### community/community-pledge.md

```diff
+# Community Pledge
+
+At Movement DAO, our collective success relies on our ability to work together in harmony. We ask that all community members adhere to our eightfold pledge for building and maintaining communities in the right way.&#x20;
+
+1. **Right view** – Right view means that community members are aligned in their values and goals for global impact. Each community will become the product of our collective spirit, optimism and hard work in developing sustainable communities for positive impact.
+2. **Right intention** – This platform is designed for real world impact. While other blockchain projects are designed for boosting economic status, we are here to turn this economic potential into changing the world. While the potential for comping EARNING is substantial, community members should consider this platform as a means to compound GIVING.
+3. **Right speech** – Unlike social media platforms that are plagued with divisiveness and inflammatory discourse, this platform is designed for people to mobilize, collaborate and make impact together. We have no time to waste with distractions like divisive speech, abuse, or unrelated chatter.
+4. **Right action** – Community members should be fully aligned with their intentions in both the physical world and the digital world. Community members should not use this platform to influence or manipulate the real world in a malignant way. Everyone should feel safe to express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction. The community should engage in non-violent communication and conflict resolution. The community must build and maintain a level of trust by quickly highlighting any instances of fraudulent or malicious activity.
+5. **Right livelihood** – It is possible for community members to grow their earn and make impact. There are several other platforms for those seeking lambos. We ask that community members don't let their earning potential detract from their giving potential.
+6. **Right effort** – Each community member has a duty to prevent, mitigate, and resolve conflict on the platform.&#x20;
+7. **Right mindfulness** – Mindfulness means that community members are consciously aware of their own biases, preconceptions, and judgements. These tendencies can become blockages of new information and can lead to further misunderstanding and miscommunication. Community members should listen to others completely and practice mindful non-violent communication.
+8. **Right concentration** – Community members should dedicate time to tasks within their communities instead of trying to multi-task. Problem solving is a dedicated effort and the communities need your focused wisdom and effort.
```

### community/mission.md

```diff
+# Mission
+
+Society already has the collective compassion, knowledge and resources to solve the world’s problems. The missing piece is a technology to bring it all together. Movement DAO uses proven applications of blockchain to align economic incentives within communities and empower them to solve problems as a collective.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO's mission is to change the world for the better and become the launchpad for the world's most impactful movements!
```

### community/vision.md

```diff
+# Vision
+
+## The Vision
+
+Today, society is increasingly demanding engagement, transparency, expediency and a seat at the table when solving problems. Our vision is for Movement DAO to become the platform that humanity turns to to make the most meaningful impact in the world.&#x20;
+
+## Movement Ideas
+
+**Social Justice**&#x20;
+
+Movements like Black Lives Matter have been profoundly effective at organizing large groups to promote real change. However, because BLM is exceedingly decentralized, the community had poor tools to effectively raise money. BLM can use Movement DAO to:
+
+1. Organize the community with [leaders](../../overview/movement-communities#how-daos-organize-on-movement-dao).&#x20;
+2. Raise money in a way that financially aligns supporters.&#x20;
+3. Transparently spend money through [initiatives](../../overview/movement-communities#how-daos-organize-on-movement-dao).&#x20;
+
+The 2017 Women's March faced similar challenges. With Movement DAO however, future movements could use an endowment model to transform a tidal wave of excitement over a short perif time into long lasting & sustained funding.&#x20;
+
+The next wave of social justice movements should organize & raise capital on Movement DAO.&#x20;
+
+**Public Arts**&#x20;
+
+The public arts are often neglected by local governments. When projects are created, they are bogged down by bureaucracy and often highly political. Rarely do they represent the whims of the people.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO enables a small & passionate community to create truly eye catching public art.&#x20;
+
+Imagine a DAO funded dog park (DOAG park) on the water in South Beach. This dog park could  feature a 20ft tall DOGE head and be prominently featured with the DAO's token symbol (hopefully $DOAG).&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO is well equipped to promote public arts.&#x20;
+
+**Prison Reform**
+
+Projects like [Free Ross DAO](https://freerossdao.com) serve as an inspiration for the impact that DAOs can have. Future movements that fight for prison reform can use the tools on Movement DAO  to take their communities further.&#x20;
+
+**Controversial Research**
+
+Today the process to receive grants for research at top academic institutions is highly politicized & bureaucratic. Often good ideas are left unfunded if they attack the status quo. A movement to democratize independent research could push science forward. Leaders&#x20;
+
+**Union Movement**&#x20;
+
+Union workers organize to support a common goal and often pay dues to support their efforts. However, unions are can be plauged with corruption and don't always represent the will of their members.&#x20;
+
+Unions could organize as a movement, with due's being paid to the movement itself.&#x20;
+
+Union members can elect leaders and have transparency into how all money is spent.&#x20;
+
+**Environmental Cleanup (Save Sea Turtles🙏🌊)**&#x20;
+
+Everyone loves sea turtles. And everyone hates plastic. Start a movement to save our environment!&#x20;

+# Repositories
+
+We branched the amazing work from [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io/), and added a number of adapters and extensions for our use case. We have a number of additional community mechanics we want to implement and have audited before we fully move on chain, however, if you want to party with us, this should provide enough of a background to get down. :man\_dancing:

+description: Have the Movement DAO contracts been audited?
+---
+
+# Security Audits
+
+**Reminder disclaimer:** Movement DAO is new technology, and no amount of testing or security audits completely eliminate risks. Please don’t supply assets you can’t afford to lose.
+
+TLDR, at launch we are employing a Gnosis Multi-signature Safe to manage the DAO funds, Community Discord to coordinate discussions, and Snapshot, after the token distribution, for voting until the OpenLaw Tribute audit is complete.&#x20;
+
+### Underway
+
+Mr. T. N. or [@t4sk](https://github.com/t4sk) is currently reviewing the existing repository and contracts and providing the development team with a recommendations report. This work is specifically targeted at the adapters and extensions as they relate to the Unagi Vault, Sushi and UniSwap liquidity deployments and the bonding curve contracts.
+
+Also underway [\`OpenLaw\`](https://tributedao.com/) themselves have engaged [SigmaPrime](https://sigmaprime.io/) to audit the Tribute contracts. We have contacted SigmaPrime and notified them of our intent to hire them to do the formal audit when we are feature complete. They asked that we do not use their name on our materials until we have signed an agreement with them. We have set aside a budget to bill against when we are closer to feature complete.
+
+### Scope of the security audit
+
+Movement DAO's core premise is to enabling a community by seeding it with multiple-millions of Ethereum to create any Movement and Actions they deem worthwhile, entrusting the collective wisdom of the community and their appointed leaders to accomplish that which has remained generally opaque to the individual - charity organizations as they operate today.
+
+Movement DAO's core is a collection of smart contracts which govern managing a pool of assets on behalf of Movement and its sub-movements, the Endowment bank. Given each Movement has its own property and funds which are managed by Movement, and adapters and extensions which govern how the funds are collected, distributed, and managed are all areas which require extensive design, analysis, and audit before it is employed on Ethereum mainnet.&#x20;

+# Thank You's!
+
+The Movement DAO team would not have been able to start on this amazing journey without the groundbreaking work of so many others. The team drew from many lessons learned and code examples some of which are listed here. We thank you here, and have earmarked tokens for these teams, as a small token of (see what I did here?) appreciation. You guys rock!

+# FAQ
+
+## Why does the world need this?
+
+We believe that society already has the collective compassion, knowledge and resources to solve all of the world’s problems. We also know that the missing piece is a technology to bring it all together. Therefore we use proven applications of blockchain to connect the people within existing communities and empower them to solve problems together.With this project, we envision a world enDAOment that can provide continuous funding to the movements and initiatives that matter most to the community.
+
+## Our vision for the future
+
+In the future, we believe people will demand engagement, transparency, expediency and collaboration in society, and a seat at the table when solving problems. We believe this platform will be what people turn to first when looking to start and fund movements.
+
+## What is a DAO? And why do we need it?
+
+A DAO is an online community built on the blockchain that introduces powerful tools designed for collaboration, decentralization, and transparency without the need for trust. This combination allows us to quickly mobilize around our most important social movements and take action quickly.
+
+## What is a "Movement"?
+
+Movement DAO supports movements, defined as communities organized around a shared mission. For example, social movements such as racial justice, environmental movements such as saving endangered species, or public goods movements such as art projects. For the first time ever, these movements have the infrastructure to finance their causes with economic alignment. For the first time ever, the infrastructure exists to prevent tragedy of the commons.
+
+## What is an "initiative"?
+
+Initiatives are projects proposed by the movement community. Token holders vote on which initiatives receive funding. Funding is provided by the reserve pool & direct tributes. Funding is distributed incrementally when predetermined milestones are achieved. Initiatives are proposed with those milestones.
+
+## What are the differences between $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens?
+
+MOVE tokens represent the potential to mint new movements and influence how the entire system is governed. In addition, the MOVE token is the native currency used to purchase movement tokens. Given this powerful utility and the inherent demand for $MOVE tokens, this token has the potential to appreciate in value over time as the ecosystem grows. The $MOVE ecosystem also earns movement tokens for each newly minted movement and revenue generated through network activity tributes. Revenue generated through network tribute goes towards the MOVE enDAOment.
+
+## What is a Defi Endowment?
+
+The Defi Endowment is a pool of tokens (both $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens) that are owned by the governance DAO. This pool of assets is used to permanently generate income for funding movements and their initiatives. Income is generated through network activity related to trading and swapping of tokens, as well as yield farming of stablecoin assets.
+
+## What are the benefits for token holders?
+
+Movement tokens have the potential to accrue value over time, as the price is directly tied to the growth of a movement community. Movement communities have the flexibility to set their own economic design including variables such as bonding curves, transaction tributes, vesting, and deflation. Movement tokens also represent voting rights for governance and funding initiatives. Like $MOVE token holders, $(Movement) token holders are incentivized to take action against malicious actors in their communities.
+
+## How are tokens distributed?
+
+Both $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens are distributed via a mechanism called a bonding curve. A bonding curve is an encoded formula that determines the price of each incremental token that is minted (purchased) or burned (sold) based on the total supply. Instead of minting a large supply of tokens at the onset of the project, Movement DAO uses this minting and burning mechanism so that these communities are formed, grow and thrive as decentralized communities from the beginning. The bonding curve is not only ideal for ensuring decentralization, fairness, and stability, it is also an important element used for continuous funding for movements.
+
+## How are initiatives funded?
+
+There are two primary forms of funding for initiatives: Passive and Active. •Passive funding occurs when the movement community uses treasury reserves to fund initiatives. Passive funding takes time and requires continuous growth and activity such as minting, burning, and swapping of tokens. Active funding occurs when community members apply tributes to their votes. Tribute votes combine the signaling of which initiatives the voter wants to fund, and also attaches direct tributes of tokens IF those initiatives are selected. Those who tribute tokens earn a boost in their voting power.
+
+## Why should I trust this platform?
+
+The Merkaba system is built in a way that designs bad behavior out of the system by using carefully designed incentive systems.First, the use of bonding curve token distribution ensures that the project will be decentralized and community owned from the beginning. The founders tokens will be locked for # years from launch, meaning there is no return on investment to the founders until the platform is fully built, operational and successful in its objectives. The system also establishes trust with its community by adopting state of the art mechanism design concepts.We have built this system on the shoulders of giants. Users can rest assured that the underlying code has been audited for functionality and security.
+
+## What are my responsibilities as a community member?
+
+There are various stakeholders and community members in the Movement DAO ecosystem. The primary stakeholders are $MOVE token holders and movement token holders.&#x20;
+
+1. $MOVE tokens represent voting rights on the platform. Token holders are able to submit proposals and vote for governance changes as well as launch and influence new movements on the platform.&#x20;
+2. $(Movement) tokens represent unique ecosystems designed specifically for supporting movements. Movement token holders are responsible for promoting, collaborating, and voting on how resources are allocated, and to which movement initiatives.
+
+## How do I get involved in the community?
+
+1. **As a movement evangelist** - Submit a proposal for a new movement or get involved in a new movement community. Movement evangelists are often those who are proposing new movements, however communities may find more influential leaders that can grow their communities better over time. Additionally, evangelists can choose to have delegates who they allocate a portion of their rewards to increase the scope of the network and its influence.
+2. **As a developer** - Join our Discord and stay active within the Developer channel. We encourage a collaborative developer community to help make the platform the best it can be.&#x20;
+3. **As a community organizer** - Decentralized communities require community members that take on leadership roles to help organize and mobilize their respective communities to take action and work together. Communities will naturally identify skillful leaders and create incentives to keep them engaged in these important roles.
+
+## How do I purchase tokens?
+
+1. Download the Metamask wallet extension for your browser at https://metamask.ioand follow details instructions at https://metamask.io/faqs.html
+2. Download the Metamask App for your mobile device
+3. Sync both applications with the QR code provided. Add funds with a debit card or Apple Pay
+4. Complete your first transaction by buying ETH
+5. Link your Metamask wallet to Movement DAO and buy $MOVE
+6. Use your $MOVE tokens to start a new movement or to buy existing movement tokens.

+
+# Glossary
+
+## **AUDIT**
+
+An audit is a comprehensive review of a system and its design to identify its strengths, weaknesses and potential vulnerability.Audits may be internal or independent and can be informal or formal audits and are meant to be a tool for project stakeholders or developers.
+
+## APY
+
+Annual Percentage Yield are a time-based measurement of the Return On Investment (ROI) on an asset. For example, $100 invested at 5% APY would yield $105 after one year, if there is no compounding of any interest earned on that $100 through the year.
+
+## AMM
+
+An AMM is a decentralized asset trading pool that enables market participants to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. AMMs are non-custodial and permissionless in nature. Most AMMs utilize either a constant product, constant mean, or constant sum market-making formula; however, the most common is a constant product market maker, most notably Uniswap.
+
+## BONDING CURVE
+
+Bonding curves are  token distribution models that automate the relationship between price and supply. The tokens in this model are referred to as Continuous Tokens because their price is continuously calculated. In continuous token models, there is no ICO or token launch. Instead of pre-selling tokens during a launch phase, the tokens are minted continuously over time via an automated market maker contract. Tokens are minted when purchased as needed, in conjunction with demand, and used within the protocol or application when required or desired.
+
+Continuous Tokens have other properties such as instant liquidity and deterministic price. Bonding curves act as an automated market maker such that token buyers and sellers have an instant market. Additionally, bonding curve models don’t have central authorities responsible for issuing the tokens. Instead, users can buy a project’s token through a smart contract platform. The cost to buy these tokens is determined by the supply of those tokens. Unlike traditional models, the cost of these tokens increases as the supply increases. This price is determined by a pre-existing algorithm, further described below. A fee of 1% is applied per trade with the bonding curve.

+## COLLATERAL FOUNDERS
+
+The founding team who contributed the collateral by which the Movement DAOs genesis bonding curve was based. Additional, the founding team contributed the seed engineering funds to establish the DAO and initiative funding workflow.
+
+## COLLATERALIZATION
+
+The borrowing of a deposit asset or assets to seek further business activities such as Yield Farming. Collateralization can amplify gains or losses, and is thus, considered riskier than not borrowing funds.&#x20;
+
+## COMPOUND INTEREST
+
+Once called the eighth wonder of the world by Einstein, compound interest allows greater interest rates and returns on investments by allowing interest gained to be automatically reinvested back in with the original deposits and accrued interest. This reinvestment period is based on the planned distribution of this interest which may be hourly, weekly, monthly, or an annual interest distribution. With compound interest, the greatest gains are often seen over a certain period in time, with a notably sharp rise in the value of investments seen at longer periods. In general, the longer a deposit benefits from compound interest, the much greater the overall gains when compared to gains made from simple interest.
+
+## CONVICTION VOTING
+
+Conviction voting is a DAO voting mechanism whereby individuals stake their powers to vote on proposals and gather enough votes to pass over time. While this mechanism is new, in theory, the it hinders persons with strong opinions and large stakes from bridling minority voters. Here, it’s not a requirement for the majority to achieve consensus on each proposal, but rather, token holders (stakeholders) can concentrate on the proposals they promote/support.
+
+## DAI
+
+A stable coin governed by MakeDAO an organization represented by a set of codified rules, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain. "When implemented well, a DAO allows for real-world experiments in decentralized democratic organization and control, with more freedom of action and less regulatory oversight for DAO controlled projects and products when compared to legacy corporate structures and organizations.
+
+## DAO
+
+A DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a transparent computer program, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government. As the rules are embedded into the code, no managers are needed, thus removing any bureaucracy or hierarchy hurdles.
+
+## DAPP
+
+A DApp is an online portal or other interactive software that enables direct interaction between end users and providers (e.g., connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, owners and stores in file storage).
+
+## DEFI
+
+Decentralized Finance (DEFI) a set of Smart Contracts running independently on blockchains such as the Ethereum network that aim to enhance the profitability of investors in DeFi through automated smart contracts. DeFi tools seek to maximize returns by providing liquidity to various other protocols. These should be considered risky investments as the infrastructure is quite new and often not fully audited.&#x20;
+
+## ENDAOMENT
+
+An EnDAOment is a principal pool of capital used as a perpetual source for earning yield via DeFi activity, used to fund various movements and initiatives within the ecosystem.
+
+## ETHEREUM
+
+Ethereum is an open-source decentralized blockchain built for smart contract development. Smart contracts allow for developers to create decentralized applications on the Ethereum infrastructure and to run their own token system on a secure and immutable platform without the need for building a dedicated blockchain.&#x20;
+
+## **ERC-20**
+
+A cryptocurrency protocol based on the Ethereum blockchain. An ERC-20 coin, by definition, uses this protocol.
+
+## FLASH LOANS
+
+A type of loan that is only possible in the world of cryptocurrencies where the token is loaned out only for the length of time it takes to complete one transaction block on the blockchain. As long as the loan is paid back before the next transaction block begins there is no interest fee incurred by the borrower. Flash Loans allow for new types of investments that are nearly instantaneous algorithmic scripts to run in Smart Contracts that can be stacked upon one another for innovative yet sometimes risky investments. Flash Loans may also have vulnerabilities that may include systems vulnerabilities that take advantage of approved existing systems but are used in a novel malicious manner.
+
+## GAS FEES
+
+Gas fees are rewards paid to Proof Of Work miners to incentivize them to support the network's transactions which become written to the blockchain. In Ethereum, this gas fee unit amount is expressed in gwei. Withdrawals or transfers to or from CEXs, DEXs Liquidity Pools, and Wallets all incur a gas fee. The amount of this gas fee will vary in cost depending on supply and demand. As currently designed: when demand on Ethereum or an ERC-20 network is at its highest, gas fees are at also their highest.
+
+## GOVERNANCE
+
+Governance refers to the control and use of a Governance coin, token, and/or project through various measures to grow the ecosystem or product and to maximize gains for governance token holders.
+
+## GOVERNANCE TOKEN ($MVMT)
+
+A token is used to govern the operations and influence the direction of a coin, token, and/or project controlled by the Governance Token. Holding these tokens are often profitable through direct price appreciation of popular governance tokens, but may come with other benefits that are only available to governance token holders and voters. Holders of the MOVE token help to shape the future of the Movement DAO ecosystem by voting on governance initiatives.
+
+## HATCH PRICE
+
+The price paid per token by when hatching a new Movement.
+
+## IMPERMANENT LOSS
+
+I Automated Market Makers (AMM) and liquidity providers (LPs) contribute assets for liquidity to market participants. These AMM pools utilize a bonding curve, typically built on a constant function market marker formula. Asset prices are constantly changed by the AMM pool in response to trading activities by participants. This is an effort to ensure that LPs can receive the same amount of assets they deposited when they withdrawal. However, due to the volatility of asset prices and arbitragers, LPs occasionally will not receive the exact amount of assets upon withdrawal. The dollar value of the assets they withdraw would typically be lower than if they had no provided liquidity and just held the assets. This dollar value shortfall is known as impermanent loss. The loss is said to be impermanent because if asset prices return to the level during withdrawal the loss is eliminated.
+
+## INITIATIVES
+
+Initiatives are projects proposed by the movement community. Token holders vote on which initiatives receive funding. Funding is provided by the reserve pool & direct tributes. Funding is distributed incrementally when predetermined milestones are achieved. Initiatives are proposed with those milestones.
+
+## INSTANT LIQUIDITY
+
+Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any time, the bonding curve acting as an automated market maker. A bonding curve contract acts as the counter-party of the transaction and always holds enough ETH in reserve to buy tokens back.
+
+## LIQUIDITY
+
+A measure of how much available circulating supply there is of an asset or currency, and the activity of that asset or currency in an exchange, economy, or network. A currency with low supply and/or circulation is said to be illiquid.
+
+## LIQUIDITY MINING
+
+An energy-efficient form of cryptocurrency mining that supports work and transactions on a blockchain usually without expensive application or hardware-specific equipment required by older forms of cryptocurrency mining.Rewards are provided to liquidity providers as a means to incentivize liquidity mining providers, in addition to growing and supporting a blockchain's user base.
+
+## LIQUIDITY POOL
+
+An LP, or Liquidity Pool, is a pool of deposited funds meant to provide liquidity to a currency, network, or Smart Contract. Liquidity is considered the lifeblood of any physical or digital currency, exchange, or financial network, so there will be designed rewards or incentives given to those who provide liquidity to LPs.s.Liquidity Providers-In the realm of cryptocurrency and DeFi, this refers to investors who deposit an asset to provide liquidity on an exchange and/or network(s) to gain an ROI on their investment. Investors deposit one or more of their digital assets into decentralized Liquidity Pools (LPs) to provide liquid capital to exchanges and smart contracts. Liquidity Providers often provide two or more types of assets, in which Impermanent Loss is sometimes seen.
+
+## LOCK AMOUNT
+
+The minimum amount of the configured token that must be locked in order to submit a proposal.
+
+## LOCK DURATION
+
+The minimum amount of time the configured token will be locked for in order to submit a proposal.
+
+## MAKERDAO
+
+Maker is a decentralized governed financial ecosystem based on a Stablecoin called DAI. DAI is algorithmically pegged to $1 USD, with no volatility. A digital asset with no volatility at all, is sometimes seen as a hedge or safety measure in times of high volatility or during Bear markets.
+
+## MARGIN
+
+An available avenue of borrowed capital that is considered very high risk, as collateral must be provided for a margin loan to secure the loan. It is called margin or a margin loan because a risky loan is being taken on the margins of the investment to hopefully amplify gains for the investor or trader.A margin loan is considered very high risk as the deposited base asset is at risk of liquidation during a margin call.
+
+## MARGIN CALL
+
+The act of implementing a Forced Liquidation or Liquidation Event when an investor or trader cannot meet debt obligations on leveraged trade positions. Margin calls can be triggered by rapidly changing market conditions and high volatility that bring Liquidation Events for some leveraged traders on exchanges and markets.
+
+## MARKET CAPITALIZATION
+
+A measure of the total funds invested in a company or project. This market cap of a coin, company, or project can be calculated by multiplying the asset's unit price by the total number of coins.x.MetaMask-MetaMask is a popular mobile or desktop software cryptocurrency wallet that can hold, transmit or receive Ethereum and ERC-20 compatible coins or tokens.
+
+## MINIMUM APPROVAL %
+
+&#x20;This is the minimum amount of approval amongst the total membership required for a proposal to be valid, this can be set high if you want to ensure people are actively participating or it can be set to 0% so there is no quorum requirement enforced.
+
+## MINING POOL
+
+A pool of cryptocurrency miners that provides mining services to a cryptocurrency network. Mining Pool operators and contributors are incentivized by a coin or token's programmed mining rewards to support transactions and provide liquidity on a coin's network.
+
+## MOVEMENT
+
+Movements are broadly defined as communities organized around a shared mission. or example, social movements such as racial justice, environmental movements such as saving endangered species, or public goods movements such as art projects. Within the Movement DAO structure, these communities are radically empowered to organize and fund their most important initiatives in a fun, secure and trustless way. For the first time ever, these movements have the infrastructure to finance their causes with economic alignment. For the first time ever, the infrastructure exists to prevent tragedy of the commons.
+
+## MOVEMENT EVANGELISTS
+
+Movement evangelists are nominated by their respective communities to spearhead movement awareness campaigns and to coordinate communities around funding. Movement Evangelists are also responsible for token giveaways. &#x20;
+
+## MULTISIG WALLET
+
+A multiple signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that controls access and changes to one or more Smart Contracts. Community governed projects like a DAO often require multiple signers to approve a transaction before it will be executed. For community-based efforts, Multisig wallets for DAOs and DeFi projects are often implemented as 6 of 9 wallets, where 6 of 9 community wallet signers must agree to sign a transaction before a Smart Contract can be implemented.
+
+## ORACLE
+
+A feed of data, such as the current market prices of an asset or assets, that provides a high confidence service to users and other services that the source and detail of the oracle's data are timely, accurate, and untampered. Sources of data may be singular or decentralized sources and may be dispersed geographically from one another. All exchanges and markets require accurate and timely information to operate properly at high efficiency. An example of the most well-known oracle protocol is Chainlink (LINK).
+
+## POOL
+
+A smart contract containing shared amounts of assets provided by depositors. Pools are either used in Automated Market Makers (AMMs)for optimized trading purposes, lending aggregation (yPool), or in shared yield farming strategies (yVaults), among other things.cc.Protocol-In High Technology, a protocol is a set of developed rules or specifications. These rules detail definitions, standards, limitations, and potential stipulations of a protocol. Examples of technology protocols include TCP/IP and ERC-20.
+
+## POST-HATCH PRICE
+
+Post-Hatch price - The price per token at the launch of the Movements when the curve is set and anyone can join with the Commons
+
+## RAGE QUIT
+
+"Rage quitting" is a function built into DAO's smart contracts that allows a member to take its unallocated capital contribution and leave the DAO.
+
+## REBALANCE
+
+To make changes to a portfolio or pool of funds for various reasons.An automated or manual tactical change to a yield farming strategy that is meant to nearly instantaneously do one or more of the following actions:Gain profits through arbitrageTake or secure profitsReduce risks to investors or pooled fundsDuring periods of high volatility, the latter is especially the case if margin or leveraged funding is used by the trader, investor, or controller in charge of pooled funds. If an assessment is made that market conditions are a risk to invested funds, mitigation efforts will be implemented either autonomously or through manual intervention to reduce risks to invested funds.
+
+## SMART CONTRACT
+
+A digital contract that is programmed in a language that is considered Turing complete, meaning that with enough processing power and time, a properly programmed Smart Contract should be able to use its code base and logical algorithms to perform almost any digital task or process. Ethereum's programming languages, such as Solidity and Vyper, are Turing complete.ff.Spread-When an order is made on an exchange or market, the disagreement of the difference in price between potential buy and sell offers of an asset is called the spread. A wide spread in price can lead to higher slippage.
+
+## SPAM PENALTY %
+
+Modifies the Lock Amount and Lock Duration depending on the number of currently active locks the proposer has.
+
+## STABLECOIN
+
+In cryptocurrency, it is a digital cryptocurrency equivalent to one (1) Dollar USD. In theory, the price of the stablecoin is pegged to the US Dollar, but in practice, there is some variance to nearly all stablecoins except for coins like DAI, which are designed with no volatility.
+
+## STAKE
+
+The act of depositing a cryptocurrency coin or token into a yield farming project and/or protocol, whether the access to the project is either through CeFi or DeFi methods. Stakers hope to gain interest on their deposits into these yield farming projects and offerings. CeFi is considered safer for several reasons -including strict rules, permitting, and regulations. However, DeFi tends to give much high rewards, while being accompanied with much higher risks, the earlier the investor participates in the project's lifecycle, testing, and development. The act of staking a cryptocurrency deposit to yield farm additional cryptocurrency via CeFi or DeFi staking offerings, programs, or projects.
+
+## TESTNET
+
+A testing network for a new token, project, or product, or for potential improvements to an existing product or offering. Testnets are used to test the viability and vulnerability of new ideas, concepts, code, and processes prior to moving on to a production network or networks of some sort.
+
+## TOKEN
+
+A type of coin, except with much greater functionality. Tokens can also be used as a method of payment like coins, but unlike coins, they can excel at other use cases such as the democratic governance of a protocol or system, or as a means to use underlying coins to make liquidity tokens from these coin deposits. These liquidity tokens could then be used in innovative new strategies elsewhere via delegated funds to amplify gains with little risk to the underlying asset the liquidity token is based upon. An investor could choose this action so that further gains to their assets may be made by using the automated actions of intelligent Smart Contracts to optimize gains.
+
+## TOTAL AVAILABLE CAPITAL
+
+Represents the total deployable capital in treasury reserves that can be used to fun initiatives within a movement. Token holders will vote to determine how to use “Total Available Capital” reserves.
+
+## **TOTAL FINANCIAL BACKING**
+
+Represents the total “potential” influence of an entire movement community. In crypto terms, one might refer to this value as market capitalization. This number represents the total assets that are collateralized in stable coins on the bonding curve.
+
+## TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS
+
+An economics problem in which every individual has an incentive to consume a resource, but at the expense of every other individual -- with no way to exclude anyone from consuming. Initially it was formulated by asking what would happen if every shepherd, acting in their own self-interest, allowed their flock to graze on the common field. If everybody does act in their apparent own best interest, it results in harmful over-consumption (all the grass is eaten, to the detriment of everyone).
+
+## TRIBUTE
+
+**Exit Tribute** - The percentage that goes to the Funding Pool when token holders 'sell' by burning their token at the price determined by the ABC. If the Exit Tribute is 10% and the price is 1 DAI/token then, for every token burned, the exiting token holder would get 0.9 Dai and the Funding Pool would get 0.1&#x20;
+
+**Hatch Tribute** - The percentage of the funds raised during the Hatch that goes directly to Funding Pool to be used to support the Commons' mission, the rest goes to the collateral pool
+
+## TURING COMPLETE
+
+In programming, it refers to a language that is powerful and semi-autonomous, in a way. When a language such as Solidity or Vyper is Turing complete, it means that with enough processing power and time, a properly programmed Smart Contract using a Turing complete language should be able to use its code base and logical algorithms to perform nearly any digital task or process. A Turing complete language can even be programmed to have impacts on real-world activities through electronic means, as these rapidly executed digital commands can trigger actions in the real world through sensors, relays, switches, cameras, alarms, and alerts that can trigger a human and/or automatic response.The concept of a Turing complete programming language was named after the inventor of the idea, Alan Turing. He was an unsung war hero and legendary mathematician. Turing was also a renowned and brilliant computer scientist, cryptanalyst, and forward thinker.
+
+## TVL
+
+Total Value Locked into a Smart Contract or set of Smart Contracts that may be deployed or stored at one or more exchanges or markets. This is used as a measurement of investor deposits. It is the dollar value of all the coins or tokens locked into a platform, protocol, lending program, yield farming program, or insurance liquidity pool.&#x20;
+
+## YIELD FARMING
+
+Yield farming is the practice of staking or lending crypto assets in order to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. This innovative yet risky and volatile application of decentralized finance (DeFi) has skyrocketed in popularity recently thanks to further innovations like liquidity mining. In short, yield farming protocols incentivize liquidity providers (LP) to stake or lock up their crypto assets in a smart contract-based liquidity pool. These incentives can be a percentage of transaction fees, interest from lenders or a governance token (see liquidity mining below). These returns are expressed as an annual percentage yield (APY). As more investors add funds to the related liquidity pool, the value of the issued returns decrease accordingly.&#x20;
+
+## VOLATILITY
+
+A statistical measure of the price variation of an asset. Newer early-stage projects in the explosive growth stage tend to see very high volatility in the price of their assets in their early days. Volatile assets are often considered riskier than less volatile assets because the price is expected to be less predictable.

+  All users should first understand the risks associated with blockchain, DeFi
+  and Smart Contracts
+---
+
+# Understanding the Risks
+
+Since every protocol or application is built with smart contracts interacting with one another in some form, smart contract failure in one of the core components could cause a ripple effect throughout the DeFi ecosystem.&#x20;
+
+This means that smart contract failure on the lower layers could lead to loss of funds in the protocols or applications that are built at the higher layers.
+
+### Mitigating Smart Contract Risks through Multiple Security Audits
+
+These smart contracts have been put through multiple security audits like the [Compound Protocol](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/compound-3.pdf) from reputable firms like [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications).
+
+
+
+## Risks with Stablecoin Pegs
+
+{% hint style="danger" %}
+**Failure to maintain its desired peg could lead to loss of funds for Stablecoin holders**
+{% endhint %}
+
+[Stablecoins](broken-reference) are designed to minimize price volatility relative to another asset by pegging to another currency (fiat, crypto) or commodity.
+
+Stablecoins can fail due to collateralization and volatility risk together with flawed mechanism designs to maintain their respective pegs.&#x20;
+
+However, the main risks are associated with specific collateral types backing these stablecoins. Overcollateralization can help to reduce volatility risk but if the prices of the underlying collateralized asset drops too quickly, liquidation might not be enough to cover the full amount that was borrowed.
+
+That being said, the risks are greatly reduced with a reasonable collateralization ratio and sound collateral types that have a monetary premium and deep liquidity like Ether or Bitcoin.
+
+Losing a desired peg could cause loss of funds for stablecoin holders and that is why at Unagii we have decided only to work with the best, time-tested and widely accepted stablecoins like [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) (which is 1:1 backed by US dollars in a bank account issued by Coinbase) and [DAI](https://makerdao.com/en/) (decentralized crypto-overcollateralized stablecoin)&#x20;
+
+
+
+## Market Risks
+
+As with all new markets and technologies, other complex risks could exist with new Financial Platforms like Compound. One of these complex risks is Market Risk and better financial models are needed to better analyze these risks.
+
+Platforms like Gauntlet have done thorough Risk Assessments like the one here :\
+[https://gauntlet.network/reports/CompoundMarketRiskAssessment.pdf](https://gauntlet.network/reports/CompoundMarketRiskAssessment.pdf)
+
+> We use a rigorous definition of market risks to construct simulation-based stress tests that evaluate the economic security of the Compound protocol as it scales to underwriting billions of dollars of borrowed assets. These stress tests are trained on historical data and put through a battery of scenarios that represent the expected and worst case economic outcomes for the protocol. Our stress tests are constructed analogously to how transaction-level backtesting is done in high-frequency and algorithmic trading. These techniques are used to estimate the market risk of a systematic trading strategy before it is deployed to the market. As there are over $1 trillion US dollars of assets managed by funds that use these techniques to provide daily actuarial analyses to risk managers, we believe that these are the best methodologies for evaluating market risk. By modifying these techniques to handle the idiosyncrasies of cryptocurrencies, we are able to provide similar statistical power in these actuarial analyses

+
+# Yield Farming
+
+[Yield Farming](../glossary#yield-farming) is a DeFi earning strategy used to optimize the earning potential of blockchain-based assets. Yield farming strategies can consist of:
+
+* Staking
+* Lending
+* Liquidity pools
+
+## Unagi Vault
+
+Unagii connects to third-party underlying Ethereum DeFi protocols that earn users high-yields on their crypto asset deposits. The Vaults optimizes yield on incentives earned from providing liquidity to AMMs (automated market makers) and lending pools, and automating the harvesting of LP (Liquidity Provisioning) rewards on a bank of whitelisted Strategies. This allows the Vaults to perform efficiently to provide gas cost-savings on Ethereum network gas fees to users and for Unagii to offer one of the lowest fees in the market.
+
+Currently, Unagii Vaults yield on the [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance) and [Convex Finance](https://www.convexfinance.com/) (utilizing [Curve Finance](https://curve.fi) as the underlying pool) protocol. We will include additional strategies with other protocols in the future.
+
+## Understanding Vaults
+
+Unagii Vaults has two category groups - [Stash](broken-reference) and [Growth](broken-reference), where users can choose to yield and diversify their assets based on their risk appetite. The Unagii smart contract is designed to allow users to deposit and withdraw the same asset freely at any time.&#x20;
+
+The Vaults pools users' deposits and automatically invests the pooled assets into a Vault's set [Strategy](broken-reference). It then auto-harvests liquidity rewards and sells them into the asset with the highest premium, compounding periodically.&#x20;
+
+{% hint style="success" %}
+The Vaults product was created to offer high-performing yields in the most efficient and optimized way possible as the DeFi market continues to explode. Unagii is set to serve amidst the rising complexities of yield opportunities so even retail crypto users have a trusted way to participate in DeFi without worrying about contributing time, effort, cost, and the technical knowledge to monitor and implement yield farming strategies themselves.
+{% endhint %}
+
+### **Stash Vaults**
+
+Stash Vaults offers users an excellent way to yield on stablecoins such as DAI, USDC and USDT, earning the highest yields on the best performing stable pools in the market. \
+\
+[Risks](broken-reference) here have been abstracted down to stablecoin issuer risks, third-party protocol risks i.e. Compound Finance and Curve Finance (plus any associated platforms included in the strategy), and Unagii Vaults protocol risks.&#x20;
+
+### Growth Vaults
+
+Growth Vaults is where we offer opportunities for users to go for growth on non-stable crypto assets like ETH and WBTC. These Vaults yield on alpha strategies that come with greater risks but much higher potential returns.&#x20;
+
+{% hint style="warning" %}
+Please understand the risks involved in depositing funds in smart contracts and read our audit to learn how the Vaults smart contracts are designed to mitigate those risks.
+{% endhint %}
+
+****
+
+## **How to use Vaults?**
+
+### Deposits
+
+Users can easily start earning yield by depositing their crypto assets into the Vaults. Once a user has connected their Ethereum wallet, a deposit takes 3 simple steps:
+
+1. Select asset to deposit
+2. Enter amount to deposit
+3. Choose gas fee option (_slow, standard, fast_) to approve and confirm deposit (_ETH gas fee payable_)
+
+_No additional steps required to further stake any tokens to boost yields. The Vaults automates the harvesting and selling of liquidity reward tokens earned in strategy, giving users complete convenience and optimized yields._
+
+### Withdrawals
+
+When a user decides to remove their assets from the Vaults, a withdrawal takes 3 simple steps:
+
+1. Select asset to withdraw
+2. Enter amount to withdraw
+3. Choose gas fee option (_slow, standard, fast_) to confirm withdrawal (_ETH gas fee payable_)
+
+Withdrawals can be done anytime. There is no lock in period, but do take note of the ETH gas fee payable relative to the size of your deposits and earnings.
+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+**Bonus**\
+In some instances under a Convex or Curve Finance strategy, deposits/withdrawals may receive some bonus that will be reflected in a user's balance. Bonuses occur when depositing/withdrawing assets with a price premium and/or for an asset with the lowest share to help rebalance a strategy's liquidity pool.
+{% endhint %}
+
+{% hint style="warning" %}
+**Slippage**\
+Deposits/withdrawals from Convex or Curve Finance strategies may be subjected to some slippage that will be reflected in a user's balance. Slippage occurs from any price volatility and from disrupting a strategy's liquidity pool balance with assets that are less valuable (relative to the pool's other assets).
+
+For deposits, it is recommended to leave your funds in the Vaults for a few days to offset any slippage.
+{% endhint %}
+
+## **Fees and Gas Cost-Savings**
+
+Unagii as a platform has one of the lowest fee model:
+
+| **Deposit Fee** | **Withdrawal Fee** | **Management Fee** | **Performance Fee**          |
+| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
+| None - 0%       | None - 0%          | None - 0%          | 10% (deducted from earnings) |
+
+{% hint style="warning" %}
+Unagii reserves the right to amend the fees at any point of time. Users will be notified of any fee changes at least one month prior to changes taking effect.
+{% endhint %}
+
+_Unlike Unagii, many other aggregators and DeFi robo-advisors often alienate the average retail yield seeker with high fees at every touchpoint, in addition to gas fees users have to incur (which can be an exorbitant amount during peak congestions on the Ethereum network)._
+
+### Gas Fees
+
+Gas fees are payable by the user and is required for transactions by any DeFi product on the Ethereum network. The speed or amount of Gwei used affects the price of the payable gas fee and how long a transaction will take to confirm.
+
+> **Higher Gwei = Higher ETH payable = Faster transaction speed**
+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+Users will need to ensure they have sufficient ETH in their wallet to pay for gas fees upon approval of permission for Unagii smart contract use, upon confirmation of a deposit, and on confirmation of a withdrawal.
+{% endhint %}
+
+### Gas Cost-Savings
+
+Unagii Vaults helps users with gas cost-savings, especially for heavy DeFi yield farmers and new users curious about liquidity mining. Unagii users will save on not needing to make costly daily transactions to stake, claim, and compound their earnings - that's at least 3 transactions saved over 3 days basis.
+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+Yield farming directly with a DeFi protocol may require users to manually stake their pool tokens received (that represent their share of ownership in the pool) to mine for governance tokens. For some, users acquire pool tokens on one platform, then harvest on another aggregator. They can then sell off the governance tokens, participate in the DAO, or further boost rewards by locking up the asset (e.g. in the case of CRV vote locking with Curve).
+
+Unagii Vaults helps to automate this yield farming process, providing users with convenience and much needed gas cost-savings.

+## Compound Finance <a href="#compound-finance" id="compound-finance"></a>
+
+[Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) is the very first lending and borrowing protocol that was launched in September 2018, allowing anyone to earn interest on or borrow crypto assets without a peer. Each lending market has a dynamic borrowing interest rate, which varies as market conditions adjust.
+
+### How is yield earned on Unagii? <a href="#how-is-yield-earned-on-unagii" id="how-is-yield-earned-on-unagii"></a>
+
+1. 1.Users' deposits are pooled in the Vaults
+2. 2.In return, users receive uTokens which represent a claim on their share of deposits with any accrued yield earned over time
+3. 3.Pooled assets are auto-deposited into the Compound strategy lending markets several times a day
+4. 4.Using the deposits as collateral, the same asset is borrowed and lent out several times to lever up on the $COMP emission yields
+5. 5.$COMP earned from lending and borrowing will automatically be sold into the native Vault asset once every 3 days
+
+**Stash Vaults**
+
+* **V1 USDC Vault and V2 USDC Vault - Compound Leveraged strategy** $USDC is a stablecoin issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets, redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars, and governed by [Centre](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc), a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. **** The Compound Leveraged strategy lends out $USDC to Compound Finance, and borrows back $USDC at a safe LTV (loan to value) ratio. This is repeated a few times to lever up the $COMP incentives that are emitted when users lend and borrow assets on Compound Finance. The $COMP tokens are automatically harvested and sold back to $USDC to compound yields. Using the same underlying asset for both lending and borrowing removes oracle pricing risks from the strategy.
+* **V1 DAI Vault - Compound Leveraged strategy** $DAI is the native stablecoin issued from [MakerDao](https://makerdao.com/), a decentralized protocol that allows you to mint the $DAI stablecoin using a variety of whitelisted tokens as collateral. The Compound Leveraged strategy lends out $DAI to Compound Finance, and borrows back $DAI at a safe LTV (loan to value) ratio. This is repeated a few times to lever up the $COMP incentives that are emitted when users lend and borrow assets on Compound Finance. The $COMP tokens are automatically harvested and sold back to $DAI to compound yields. Using the same underlying asset for both lending and borrowing removes oracle pricing risks from the strategy.
+
+## Curve Finance <a href="#curve-finance" id="curve-finance"></a>
+
+[Curve Finance](https://curve.fi/) is one of the earliest automated market maker (AMM), a type of decentralized exchange protocol in the market. It was launched in early January 2020.Curve operates as an exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for (1) efficient stablecoin and crypto asset trading with extremely low slippage (2) low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers, without an opportunity cost.
+
+### Enhancing yield with Convex Finance <a href="#enhancing-yield-with-convex-finance" id="enhancing-yield-with-convex-finance"></a>
+
+Convex allows liquidity providers on Curve to earn trading fees and claim boosted $CRV **** without locking $CRV **** themselves. Liquidity providers can receive boosted $CRV **** and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort.On top of earning $CRV, liquidity providers also receive liquidity mining rewards in the form of $CVX, hence boosting the yield for Unagii users.

+### How is yield earned on Unagii? <a href="#how-is-yield-earned-on-unagii-1" id="how-is-yield-earned-on-unagii-1"></a>
+
+1. 1.Users' deposits are pooled in the Vaults
+2. 2.In return, users receive uTokens which represent a claim on their share of deposits with any accrued yield earned over time
+3. 3.Pooled assets are auto-deposited into the Curve strategy liquidity pool several times a day
+4. 4.LP (liquidity provider) tokens are received in return and auto-staked into the Convex staking pool (or Curve staking pool for V1 vaults)
+5. 5.$CRV (and $CVX and any other incentive tokens) earned from staking will automatically be sold into the highest premium asset once every 3 days
+
+**Stash Vaults**
+
+* **V1 USDT Vault - Curve USDP Metapool strategy** $USDP is the native stablecoin issued from [Unit protocol](https://docs.unit.xyz/), a decentralized protocol that allows you to mint the stablecoin $USDP using a variety of whitelisted tokens as collateral. Providing liquidity to the $USDP Curve pool will allow Unagii users to earn trading fees from trades on Curve and $CRV incentives via staking of the LP tokens. Rewards will be sold into the most premium Stablecoin and compounded.
+* **V2 USDT Vault and V2 DAI Vault - Convex alUSD Metapool strategy** $alUSD is the synthetic stablecoin issued from [Alchemix](https://alchemix.fi/), a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform that gives you advances on your yield farming via a synthetic token that represents a fungible claim on any underlying collateral in the Alchemix protocol. For more information on how Alchemix works, kindly visit their [documentation](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/alchemix-finance/vaults). **** Providing liquidity to the $alUSD Convex pool will allow Unagii users to earn trading fees from trades on Curve, as well as $CRV, $CVX and $ALCX incentives via staking of the LP tokens. Rewards will be sold into the most premium Stablecoin and compounded.
+
+**Growth Vaults**
+
+* **V1 WBTC Vault - Curve oBTC Metapool strategy** This Metapool helps further increase the liquidity of Bitcoin on Ethereum and makes it easier for users to swap between different variants of wrapped $BTC. $oBTC is backed by $BTC and created by [BoringDAO](https://www.boringdao.com/) – a decentralized bridge that allows users to transfer assets across blockchains via a minting tunnel. **** After Unagii deposits pooled assets in the strategy pool, we’ll receive our share of LP tokens which will be staked for $CRV and $BOR in the DAO liquidity gauge. We’ll then claim them from the minter gauge and sell them down to the most premium wrapped $BTC compound the earnings. Providing liquidity into this pool will also accrue trading fees from Curve users on the exchange of four different kinds of pegged-BTC tokens (including $oBTC) with low slippage.
+* **V1 WBTC Vault - Curve BBTC Metapool strategy** [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901212/Explore-the-DeFi-Ecosystem-with-BTokens-Introducing-Wrapped-Tokens-on-Ethereum-) Wrapped BTC is an ERC20 version of BTC that is issued by Binance as part of their BTokens offering.Deposits will be pooled in the strategy pool, where we’ll receive our share of LP tokens which will be staked for $CRV in the DAO liquidity gauge. We’ll then claim them from the minter gauge and sell them down to the most premium wrapped $BTC and compound the earnings. Providing liquidity into this pool will also accrue trading fees from Curve users on the exchange of four different kinds of pegged-BTC tokens (including $BBTC) with low slippage.
+* **V2 WBTC Vault - Convex BBTC Metapool strategy** Essentially the same as V1 WBTC Vault - Curve BBTC Metapool strategy, but with LP tokens staked into Convex pool instead to earn $CVX on top of $CRV.
+* **V1 ETH Vault - Curve stETH pool strategy** This pool helps make staked $ETH 2.0 more liquid, so users can retain exposure and earn rewards. $stETH is a tokenised form of staked Ether native to [Lido Finance](https://lido.fi/) – a staking solution for $ETH 2.0 built and backed by several industry-leading staking providers. By providing liquidity to this pool on behalf of Unagii users, Unagii will earn trading fees from Curve exchange transactions that take place within this pool. On top of that, we’ll also receive LP tokens in return which we’ll stake into the Curve gauge to receive $LDO and $CRV incentivized rewards. These rewards will then be sold into the most premium Ether and compounded. Users will be able to withdraw from the vault anytime in $ETH or $stETH.
+* **V2 ETH Vault - Convex stETH pool strategy** Essentially the same as V1 ETH Vault - Curve stETH pool strategy, but with LP tokens staked into Convex pool instead to earn $CVX on top of $CRV and $LDO.
+
+## V1 Vaults <a href="#v1-vaults" id="v1-vaults"></a>
+
+Unagii Vaults V1 is an Ethereum-based protocol that enables users to passively earn from automated yield farming by depositing single crypto assets into the [Vaults](https://docs.unagii.com/unagii-vaults/understanding-vaults#the-vaults) executing a specific [Strategy](https://docs.unagii.com/unagii-vaults/strategies) in a gas-efficient environment.

+
+## V2 Vaults <a href="#v2-vaults" id="v2-vaults"></a>
+
+Unagii Vaults V2 is the next iteration of the protocol with a slightly different architecture:
+
+* Vaults are upgradable by default as the Unagii Token contracts and the Vault contracts are separated, making it similar in design with Curve token and Curve pool contract
+* Smart contracts can interact (deposit/withdraw) from the vaults, which allows any developer to integrate with Unagii Vaults V2 (there is a block delay)
+* Vaults are protected from flash loan attacks as Unagii token tracks the lastest block number of the caller
+* Protected from sandwich attack on harvest as profit is vested over a period of time (6 hours for now)
+* Vaults are able to invest in multiple strategies, allowing the protocol to maximize returns by optimizing the allocation of funds to each strategy

This Agreement governs your use of Movement DAO and constitutes a legally binding agreement between each user (“you,” “your,” or “User”) and Movement DAO (“we,” “us,” or “our”
+
+We may revise these Terms at any time without notice to you. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at [https://move.xyz](https://move.xyz).&#x20;
+
+In order to be a contributor to Movement DAO or purchase tokens on the DAO, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (“Account”). You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18) to obtain an Account, unless a specific Service permits otherwise.
+
+**Overview**
+
+This section is a brief summary of the highlights of the terms of use of the DAO’s website or services.  We know that many terms of services can be long and full of confusing language so we have done our best to summarize the Terms in language that you will understand.  When you accept this Agreement, you are accepting all of our Terms and not just this section. Simply by browsing the Site, you are agreeing to our Terms, so please read carefully.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO is an experimental, novel approach to nonprofits devoted to performing good works and encouraging social justice in today’s contemporary society.  The DAO is a blockchain-based organization that raises funds through the purchase of tokens that entitles the purchaser, or member, to champion specific nonprofit works or projects and seek additional funding from like-minded individuals.  Movement DAO hosts blockchain software as a backend service for customers who set up their own accounts and purchase tokens.
+
+Movement DAO is neither designed to be, nor is it set up to be, an investment vehicle and no jurisdiction has deemed any token produced by Movement DAO to be a “security” as defined by the 1933 Securities and Exchange Act (“The Act”).  Movement DAO is specifically designed to take advantage of the benefits of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies to ensure that contributions to nonprofit works will have a larger impact based upon larger financial backing than traditional nonprofit corporations or charities. &#x20;
+
+How You Accept These Terms
+
+By accessing our site or setting up an account in any manner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms, as well as the accompanying privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”), which is accessible at https://move.xyz.
+
+Note that we reserve the right to modify the Terms at any time in our sole discretion. Any changes to the Terms will be posted on our website at https://move.xyz and will become effective immediately upon posting. It is your responsibility to check for updates to these Terms periodically.
+
+**Eligibility**
+
+You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than eighteen (18) years of age), to contribute to Movement DAO or purchase tokens. In addition the purchase of tokens at this point is limited to those who qualify as “accredited” investors under the Act. &#x20;
+
+You can only participate in and enjoy the benefits of membership to the extent the laws of your jurisdiction or the laws of the United States do not bar you from doing so. Please make sure these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you.
+
+By contributing to Movement DAO or becoming a member of our community, you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements we outline in these Terms. We always reserve the right to exercise our discretion as we see fit to refuse to allow certain individuals to contribute or become members of the DAO and further we may also change our eligibility criteria at any time.
+
+Your Account With Movement DAO
+
+In order to become a member of our community, you will need to create an Account to be able to purchase tokens as outlined above.  In order to create an Account, you will need to provide us with your your full name, organization, email address, phone number, billing address and account login information. In addition, we may collect information regarding other accounts you choose to link with Movement DAO (e.g., Metamask, Google, etc.).
+
+By creating an Account, here are a few common sense rules and acknowledgements that we ask you comply with and understand:
+
+**Be honest with us**. Provide accurate information about yourself. It is not copacetic to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your Account. Any failure to provide complete and accurate information can lead to the immediate termination of your Account -- and we do not want to do that!
+
+**You are responsible for your Account**. You are solely responsible for any activity on your Account or any actions undertaken by your membership in a community. If you are sharing an Account with other people (e.g., if you are representing a business entity or trust), then you will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you are registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business and must notify us that you are purchasing the tokens on behalf of a business which membership shall be managed by you. Your Account is not transferable. You are solely responsible for any activity on your Account, so it is important to keep your Account password secure. In case of a dispute over the identity of the user, the authorized account holder of the Movement DAO or purchaser of the tokens will be deemed to be the user. “Authorized account holder” of an account is defined as the natural person assigned to the email address associated with the Account.
+
+**Be clear about our relationship**. Creating an account and purchasing tokens from Movement DAO does not create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchisee relationship with the DAO. No confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created with the DAO other than pursuant to these Terms.  You will become a member of the community and enjoy all of the rights and benefits of membership as outlined above. &#x20;
+
+**Passwords**. You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access Movement DAO or any wallet designed to hold any tokens purchased through the DAO.  We encourage you to use “strong” passwords with your Account.&#x20;
+
+**Emails**. By creating an Account, you agree that you may receive communications from Movement DAO, such as newsletters, special offers, and account reminders and updates. You will also receive emails or communications designed to update you on any project or movement that you have indicated interests you and in which you wish to participate. &#x20;
+
+**Impersonation**. If someone has created an account in which he or she pretends to be you, and you send us a request to take down that account, please be sure that you have included the email address of the fake account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify us upon becoming aware of any unauthorized use of your password or Account or any other breach of security; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session when using Movement DAO.

+description: Let's start a movement. As of January 28, 2022.
+---
+
+# Let's start a movement
+
+## Unleashing our collective potential
+
+Solving societal problems is an age-old challenge with few solutions. To date, there have been two we've relied on: government and nonprofits. Both require immense amount of capital to support their legacy infrastructure and bureaucratic processes void of accountability. The more dollars spent, the more inefficient, ineffective, and corrupt they become. The people, who's hard-earned dollars have been siphoned into these black holes, are only left with broken promises. The result: with every $1 contributed, $0.99 goes to the void, and $0.01 goes to impact.
+
+What if the opposite were true? What if $1 in contribution could become $2, $3, and $4 in impact?
+
+Introducing Movement DAO, a radical new approach to collective problem solving. Understand how it works, and see a new world filled with optimism for solving our toughest problems. Begin seeing applications for solving every type of problem. Question why we've never thought of this before.
+
+Movement DAO harnesses the crowd's collective wisdom and capital to catalyze change. Instead of fighting, we can engage with this new medium: one where we may join hands and work together, incentives full aligned, to produce change.
+
+Movement DAO recognizes that the solution to global problem-solving is simple:&#x20;
+
+1. Build aligned incentive mechanisms that are equitable for all participants,
+2. Leverage technology that is tested, trusted, and transparent, and
+3. Make it easy to use to everyone.
+
+## The vision: turn community into impact
+
+Movement DAO is transforming how communities organize to solve problems. It innovates in three key areas:
+
+1. [How DAOs organize to solve problems](../overview/movement-communities).&#x20;
+2. [How DAOs raise capital to align their supporters](../overview/movement-capital).&#x20;
+3. [How endowments best deploy capital](../overview/compound-giving).&#x20;
+
+These innovations are combined with an easy to use interface which requires little to no prior crypto knowledge.
+
+## Our three key beliefs
+
+We believe the world already has:
+
+1. The collective wisdom to solve its problems.&#x20;
+2. The resources to solve its problems.&#x20;
+3. The passion to solve its problems.&#x20;
+
+## How does it work?&#x20;
+
+The Movement DAO is made up of two token systems.
+
+1. The **$MOVE token** governs the platform. These token holders are responsible for growing the endowment and deploying capital into movements.
+2. **$(Movement) tokens** govern individual movements. These token holders are responsible for funding & supporting their communities' projects. Movements have their own symbol (ie. $BLM).&#x20;
+
+_These tokens will be used to provide authentication into community chat rooms (Discord), voting activities (Snapshot), and participation in the movement. However the token does not entitle the holder to the expectation of any profits from a movement nor is there a guarantee that the tokens will increase in value over time. The purchase of the governance token is simply the threshold that allows the purchaser to participate in the governance of the movement endowment that allows the purchaser a voice in the movements that the DAO should support_
+
+## What's a movement?&#x20;
+
+A DAO community, organized around a shared mission, that lives on Movement DAO.&#x20;
+
+Movements can support **social, community, art, green, and public goods** causes amongst many others. The only limitation is our own imagination.
+
+Learn more about the [vision for movements](../community/vision#movement-ideas) on Movement DAO.
+
+## Who runs Movement DAO?&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO was coded by John Galt and is run entirely by the community.&#x20;

+# Community Funding
+
+## Overview
+
+The founders strongly believe in directly rewarding the community members who make Movement DAO possible.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO will choose the most impactful Movement DAO community members to receive a steady salary in tokens for supporting Movement DAO.&#x20;
+
+For the first 18 months of the project, at the end of every month, the community will vote on who had the biggest impact. Movement DAO will use [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com) to facilitate this community giveaway.&#x20;
+
+**Movement DAO has earmarked 5% of tokens for the community and will distribute over $1,000,000 in tokens over the first year directly for community contributions.**&#x20;

+5. Pre-sale tokens can be claimed starting on 02/02/2022 at 02:22am GMT. &#x20;
+6. Pre-sale tokens never expire. They can always be claimed.&#x20;
+7. After January 30th tokens will only be available for swapping on major exchanges.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO will insure that there is sufficient liquidity for tokens.&#x20;
+
+_The Movement DAO will conduct a “pre-sale” to qualified investors to help seed the community and identify those community members who are passionate about movements who will sponsor, lead and shape the first movements in the DAO_

+First, make sure you have an Ethereum wallet setup. Two popular options are [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me) and [Metamask](https://metamask.io). Second, get those tokens.&#x20;
+
+**1)** Navigate to the token pre-sale page.&#x20;
+
+**2)** Select your base currency. You can purchase $MOVE in ETH or DAI.&#x20;
+
+**3)** Connect your wallet.&#x20;
+
+**4)** Approve transaction in wallet.&#x20;
+
+**5)** Party 🎉 🎈 🪅&#x20;

+
+## How do I send tokens from a centralized exchange (ie. Coinbase, Gemini, etc.)
+
+Major exchanges (such as Coinbase & Gemini) do not support wallet connect and therefore cannot be used to purchase presale tokens.&#x20;
+
+These users face two options:&#x20;
+
+**Option 1**
+
+1. [Setup an Ethereum wallet](https://learn.rainbow.me/create-backup-your-first-ethereum-web3-wallet)
+2. [transfer tokens to the wallet](https://learn.rainbow.me/sending-eth-from-a-crypto-exchange-to-your-wallet)
+3. [then simply use your new wallet](https://learn.rainbow.me/connect-your-wallet-to-a-website-or-app)
+
+You can use any [compatible Ethereum wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/).&#x20;
+
+Or
+
+1. Send tokens from your Coinbase account to [movedao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x589e5fdc62838d70169b9fd1368f41c7d42c6d5b)
+2. Share a screenshot of your transaction in discord&#x20;
+3. Specify the ERC-20 compatible wallet address you'd like to receive tokens
+
+We do not recommend this method as it will add extra work for our community, and is prone to error. We recommend setting up a proper Ethereum wallet.&#x20;
+
+## How are my total tokens calculated?&#x20;
+
+Token prices for tokens purchased during the pre-sale are calculated at the end of the token release. Tokens will be distributed via a Merkel Airdrop. Token prices are not calculated in real time for a few reasons:&#x20;
+
+1. Lower gas fees. Anyone who purchases tokens in the pre-sale will pay notably lower gas fees than those who swapped.&#x20;
+2. Dynamically set pricing. Because exponential curves can quickly grow out of control it is important to calculate exact coefficients after-the-fact.&#x20;
+3. Most importantly, the community should have a voice in how the bonding curve is priced. &#x20;
+
+The target discount for the last bonding curve purchase to the listed LP price is \~20%. &#x20;
+
+## How do I claim my tokens?&#x20;
+
+**1)** Go to the claim token page&#x20;
+
+**2)** Connect your wallet (for twitter connect see here)&#x20;
+
+**3)** Pay gas fees and claim token
+
+## How do I know the token launch is fair?
+
+Movement DAO cares deeply about building healthy communities. Therefore, an ethical token release is core to our mission. Movement DAO is taking the following steps to insure a transparent, equitable, and community oriented launch:&#x20;
+
+1. When transferring tokens from the bonding curve wallet into the movement vault, the community has the right to veto the destination address. Therefore, community funds cannot be moved without community approval.&#x20;
+2. A registered law firm acts as a signatory on the \[the] funds wallet. They **therefore owe a fiduciary duty to the movement and will employ their expertise to ensure that no funds are moved in violation of the movement rules and no requests for funding would be indicative of fraudulent activity.** &#x20;
+3. Tokens will not be distributed without community approval. The community will have 72 hours to review the Merkel airdrop list.&#x20;
+4. John Galt's tokens are _**“locked” after launch meaning that none of Galt's tokens can be re-sold to a community member or transferred to a third party for value.**_&#x20;
+5. Funds raised from the movement bonding curve go into an [endowment](../../overview/movement-capital) as opposed to a liquid spending pool. This endowment helps to preserve long term funding for the project.&#x20;

+## How does a twitter giveaway tree work?&#x20;
+
+If you've been nominated for a twitter giveaway you must respond to the tweet that nominated you. In your response tweet you must tag two or more accounts to receive a giveaway.&#x20;
+
+Your tweet can say anything, however, we recommend briefly explaining what's going on.&#x20;
+
+For example, "... giving away $8,333 in @movementdao\_eth tokens to @jack @elonmusk #lsm"&#x20;
+
+Anyone you tag in the nomination tweet will be automatically nominated and eligible for tokens.&#x20;
+
+Half your token giveaway will be give to you and the other half will be split equally among everyone you nominate. You must nominate two or more people in order to get your own tokens.&#x20;
+
+## How do I get my giveaway tokens?
+
+Tokens can be claimed after the token presale. On the token claim page you will first connect your twitter account. Next, you will connect your wallet.&#x20;

+# Basics
+
+## $MOVE Governance tokens
+
+The Movement DAO is governed by its token holders. **$MOVE** tokens are the native currency used to create, mint or buy new [movement tokens](#individual-usdmovement-tokens). **$MOVE** tokens also represent the power to influence change to governance, economics, and incentives in the Movement DAO.
+
+Benefits to **$MOVE** token holders:
+
+* Governance vote for projects anywhere in the network&#x20;
+* Governance vote on how to best manage the endowment&#x20;
+* Governance vote on all community based decisions&#x20;
+
+_$MOVE Governance tokens are not to be deemed or interpreted to be representative of any kind of:_
+
+* _Currency, legal tender, money or deposit_
+* _Investment (whether secured or unsecured), equity interest, proprietary interest and economic rights_
+* _Equity, debt or hybrid instrument, security collective investment scheme managed fund, financial derivative, futures contract, deposit, commercial paper, negotiable instrument, investment contract, note, bond, warrant, certificate or instrument entitling the holder to interest, dividends or any kind of return, nor any other financial instrument; or..._
+* _Right, title, interest or benefit whatsoever in whole or in part, in any person or property, or any assets_
+
+_$MOVE Governance tokens are not guaranteed or secured by any person, asset or entity in any way. The team is not under any obligation to issue replacement tokens if they are lost, stolen, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible for any reason._
+
+## Individual $Movement tokens
+
+Movement token holders are responsible for voting on the leadership of their movements, along with determining economic design and governance aspects of the movements. $(Movement) tokens have their own unique ticker symbols ($BLM, for example). Most importantly, the movement token holder communities collaborate and vote on which leaders to elect. These leaders choose the [actions](broken-reference) they wish to fund.
+
+Benefits to **$(Movement)** token holders
+
+* Governance of the Movement and governance proposals
+* Launch movement actions&#x20;
+* Elect movement leaders&#x20;
+
+_$Movement tokens are not to be deemed or interpreted to be representative of any kind of:_
+
+* _Currency, legal tender, money or deposit_
+* _Investment (whether secured or unsecured), equity interest, proprietary interest and economic rights_
+* _Equity, debt or hybrid instrument, security collective investment scheme managed fund, financial derivative, futures contract, deposit, commercial paper, negotiable instrument, investment contract, note, bond, warrant, certificate or instrument entitling the holder to interest, dividends or any kind of return, nor any other financial instrument; or..._
+* _right, title, interest or benefit whatsoever in whole or in part, in any person or property, or any assets_
+
+_$Movement tokens are not guaranteed or secured by any person, asset or entity in any way. The team is not under any obligation to issue replacement tokens if they are lost, stolen, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible for any reason._
+
+## Token Distribution
+
+$MOVE tokens and $(Movement) tokens are distributed using a [bonding curve](../../learning/glossary#bonding-curve), a systematic formula that determines the price at which each incremental token is minted based on total supply. This mechanism makes for a fair and sustainable foundation for building a decentralized community.&#x20;
+
+## The Movement DAO Endowment
+
+The traditional endowment uses its principal funding to earn a rate of return used to fund actions within an organization. This process is hindered by a great deal of bureaucratic friction and costly intermediaries in order to operate. The nature of decentralized communities and decentralized finance ([DeFi](../../learning/glossary#defi)) mechanisms allow for a new innovation in continuous funding we call the endowment.
+
+The Movement DAO uses the funding power of the platform to continuously fund its community managed endowment. The endowment pool utilizes DeFi tools to generate yield on the endowment principal. All of the earnings of the Movement DAO go into the $MOVE endowment. The community controls how the assets of the $MOVE endowment are managed to generate returns and decide how to allocate the returns on $MOVE endowment capital. The principal balance of the endowment is designed to stay locked in perpetuity and to provide continuous funding to the Movements it supports.
+
+**Movement DAO Endowment Funding** comes from:
+
+1. Earning an allocation of tokens for each newly minted $(Movement).
+2. Tributes related to network activity such as minting, burning, swapping, proposal submissions, and early liquidation of vested tokens.&#x20;
+
+**Ongoing Endowment Growth** comes from:
+
+1. Yield farming of $MOVE tokens
+2. Swapping activity between $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens
+
+Proceeds of endowment earnings are deployed by the community.&#x20;

+# Compound Giving
+
+Movement DAO manages a platform wide endowment which generates continuous revenue. This revenue creates sustainable movementing funding.
+
+### How the Movement DAO endowment works
+
+Perhaps Movement DAO's most disruptive quality is its platform wide endowment. This endowment is seeded by the developers who answer to no VCs or investors. They locked their investment in the platform to generate predictable ongoing revenue for the community.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO tokens holders are responsible for effectively deploying revenue generated from the endowment. They can deploy this revenue into any of the following:&#x20;
+
+1. Compensating community members&#x20;
+2. Funding platform development&#x20;
+3. Purchasing movement tokens to be held in the Movement DAO endowment&#x20;
+4. Funding movement budget's directly&#x20;
+5. Funding movement endowments directly&#x20;
+6. Funding movement actions directly&#x20;
+7. Re-investing directly into the Movement DAO endowment&#x20;
+8. Funding giveaways to grow the platform&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO token holders also govern how the endowment manages its assets. These decisions include:&#x20;
+
+1. What tokens, and in what proportions, the endowment should hold&#x20;
+2. How tokens should be priced (Movement DAO controls a large amount of the liquidity and therefore controls the LP)&#x20;
+3. How to set an optimal platform tribute amount for movements and actions (submitting movements and actions require a platform tribute)&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO is fully managed by its token holders.&#x20;
+
+
+
+## How does an endowment work logistically?
+
+Movement DAO has a pool of capital called an endowment. Money in the endowment cannot be spent. The endowment's yield funds the platform.&#x20;
+
+The endowment capital also backs the tokens. Token holds will be able to sell their tokens back to the endowment for a pro-rata share of the entire endowment.&#x20;
+
+The endowment use an [Unagii vault](https://www.unagii.com) to store assets.&#x20;
+
+## What are the underlying assets in the endowment?
+
+Movement DAO's initial endowment holds $MOVE, $DAI and some $ETH. When movements are created Movement DAO will hold movement tokens in its endowment. It will use these tokens to provide liquidity. The Movement DAO endowment will earn LP fees.&#x20;
+
+The community retains the voting power to re-allocate capital.&#x20;
+
+## &#x20;How does the endowment earn money?
+
+1. Yield farming the budget pool
+2. Yield farming assets in the endowment
+3. Owning a half of all movement tokens, for each movement (these tokens are used to provide liquidity for token holders) (the endowment will grow proportionally to the ecosystem)&#x20;
+4. Network tributes when submitting movements&#x20;
+5. Tribute when selling vested tokens early&#x20;
+6. LP fees for providing liquidity on movement tokens&#x20;
+7. Profits from any revenue generating initiatives&#x20;

### overview/movement-capital.md

```diff
+# Movement Capital
+
+Movement DAO seeks to equip movements with the best in DeFi by enabling them to benefit from a fully featured token built into their DAO.
+
+### How movements raise capital on Movement DAO
+
+Movements are automatically created with a DeFi token ready to be listed on major DEX exchanges. This token includes key features to assist stable growth.&#x20;
+
+**Token Backed Endowment**
+
+All movements are created with two capital pools: a budget pool and an endowment pool.&#x20;
+
+The budget pool represents discretionary capital availible for movements to spend on actions. Most DAOs today manage money in this way. Movement DAO introduces a second pool, the backed endowment.&#x20;
+
+The principal capital in a movement's endowment cannot be spent. By default, money put towards a movement goes into its endowment.&#x20;
+
+An endowment allows movements to implicitly back their token price. For example, assume a movement has 1 million tokens and 10 million DAI in its endowment. Because this DAI is locked it implicitly backs each token at 10 DAI. More importantly, the endowment model sets up the infrastructure for explicitly backed tokens, a feature in the DAO roadmap.&#x20;
+
+Explicitly backed tokens can be sold back to the movement contract for their backed price. For example, assume a movement has 1 million tokens, 10 million DAI in its endowment, and 1 million DAI in its budget. A token could be sold back to the movement contract for 11 DAI. The movement will then burn this token.&#x20;
+
+Backed endowment tokens provide movements a trustless financing mechanism with profound implications.&#x20;
+
+For example, endowments can use backed endowments to meaningfully democratize access to DAO creation. Today, communities have few tools to guarantee that a new DAO is legitimate. This lack of trust has an unintended side effect. Major established players ([groups](https://pleasr.org) we do love & respect) in the DAO community have an unfair advantage. Trustless financing through an endowment enables anyone to create a movement while protecting their community's contributions.&#x20;
+
+Additionally, backed endowments allow for dead or unsuccessful movements to be equitably unwound. If a movement raises money for an unsuccessful cause (😡Ken Griffin) and spends little to no money, community members have confidence that they can redeem their tokens. &#x20;
+
+Finally, endowments can reduce fraud. Endowments minimize the capital that a bad actors could remove from a community at one time.&#x20;
+
+Movement endowments generate ongoing revenue through:
+
+1. Yield farming their principal
+2. A tribute to submit actions&#x20;
+3. Optional LP fees.&#x20;
+
+A note on LP fees: Given that Movement DAO will own the largest pool of movement tokens for any movement it will be the primary LP & earn fees for swapping. The Movement DAO community can elect to give Movements their associated swapping fees.&#x20;
+
+A note on yield farming: In order to minimize gas costs and maximize net yield all movements on Movement DAO combine funds to yield farm. Yield distribution is technically determined by the Movement DAO community, but is designed to be distributed pro-rata to the individual movements.&#x20;
+
+A note on backed tokens: This functionality is in the roadmap for movements, and Movement DAO.&#x20;
+
+**Customized Funding Mechanisms**&#x20;
+
+The movement budget is funded through custom funding mechanisms. These funding mechanisms are defined by the movement and can include entry tributes, exit tributes, endowment deflation and vesting penalties.&#x20;
+
+Customized funding mechanisms enables communities with diverse goals to effectively raise capital.&#x20;
+
+For example, a community could organize to create ongoing funding for ocean cleanup. They would not set an entry or exit tribute and instead all capital would live in their endowment. Their budget would be funded through a low predefined deflation on the endowment. Therefore, community members have confidence in a predictable & sustainable community budget.&#x20;
+
+Alternatively, a community could rapidly organize to support victims of a natural disaster. They would set a 100% entry tribute and quickly deploy all funds raised.&#x20;
+
+Finally, a movement that's popular in the media ($ROSS) could implement a long vesting period to dissuade pump and dump activity. This vesting period ensures that community members join the movement for the right reasons.&#x20;
+
+**Future Innovation**
+
+Movement funding mechanisms are fully modular and the project is still in its early stages. Movement DAO was designed for the community to build on further features. These can include:&#x20;
+
+1. Customized and complex bonding curve shapes. These choices will enable movements to further align their financing with their values.&#x20;
+2. Implementing direct token backing. As discussed above, direct token backing helps to democratize DAOs.&#x20;
+3. Exploring the cutting edge in DeFi and giving movements the option to implement similar contracts.&#x20;
+4. Sophisticated price discovery for LPs.&#x20;
+5. Enabling movements the option to add continuous funding.&#x20;
+6. Enable an individual to seed a movement with ERC-20 tokens.&#x20;

+# Movement Communities
+
+Movement DAO envisions a world where decentralized communities organize & operate with the efficiency of a startup.
+
+### **How DAOs organize on Movement DAO**
+
+Movements include a few key features to help their communities organize.&#x20;
+
+**Leaders**
+
+First, all movements have the option to create leadership positions, define election cycles, define compensation, and then elect those leaders. Movement leaders have predefined, fixed, voting power. The first leaders for a movement can either be hardcoded, or voted on by the community. Movement leaders are a dynamic feature that can enable many different types of communities to effectively organize.&#x20;
+
+**Actions**&#x20;
+
+All movements include Actions. Actions are a request for capital submitted by an individual, to a movement. This request describes the use of funds, milestones to release capital, official roles, and an ability for the submitter to verify their public identity through twitter integration.&#x20;
+
+Milestones enable a trustless system for deploying capital in stages for a large proeject. For example, assume Bill Nye the science guy wanted money to organize free science lessons for the community in Washington Square Park. He could submit an Action which describes multiple key milestones, such as getting started, securing a city permit, paying volunteers, purchasing supplies and finally giving the community lessons.&#x20;
+
+Now assume Bill Nye needs $10,000 to fully complete his Action. And he gets $2,000 upon successful completion of each milestone. Because Bill Nye is only compensated on a milestone basis, if the city were to deny his permit, the movement would have only paid Bill Nye $2,000, instead of the total $10,000. These milestones help to create a trustless system for deploying capital.&#x20;
+
+Milestone completion is verified and voted on by the community.&#x20;
+
+Actions also feature identity verification to reduce fraud. For example, when Bill Nye submits his Action he can prove that he is in fact the real Bill Nye, instead of the nefarious Nill Bye. He proves his identity by linking his twitter account to the movement.&#x20;
+
+Actions include access to a service provider who can convert crypto into USD. For example, assume a movement would like to pay an architect to create a DAOG park. The architect might still live in past and tragically not use crypto. Therefore, the movement can convert $DAI to USD through a law firm who acts as a service provider to the platform.&#x20;
+
+Finally, Actions can create discrete roles. For example, an Action to setup a twitter following for a movement could feature a twitter manager who is compensated in tokens on a regular basis.&#x20;
+
+Actions are the only mechanism to remove money from Movement DAO. All Actions have a 24 hour veto period before funds are moved. If the community suspects fraud they can flag the Action. Select community members possess veto power over all funds that exit Movement DAO. This process adds an extra layer of security for the Movement DAO community.&#x20;
+
+Actions can also be packaged with complex voting mechanisms, such as [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), [quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting), [delegate voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegate\_\(American\_politics\)), [whitelist voting](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitelist), and others.&#x20;
+
+**Future Innovation**
+
+Movement DAO is built with a modular architecture and is designed to benefit from future innovations to enable community collaboration. For example:
+
+1. Movements can use "Gelato" (in development by Open Law) to enable gasless voting. We hope this innovation will help to further democratize DAO access to communities everywhere.&#x20;
+2. Interface improvements. The best interface for a DAO is a challenging problem that will require continuous innovation.&#x20;
+3. Actions can be infinitely deployed. For example, assume a movement wants to create a $1,000 reward for every 1,000 trees that someone plants. It can create this actions once and anyone can claim the reward forever.&#x20;
+
+## What is a movement?
+
+Movements are social communities powered by blockchain, in a unique structure called a [DAO](../../learning/glossary#dao). DOAs allow communities to communicate about shared goals, collaborate, coordinate and effectively fund projects.&#x20;
+
+Movements are an innovative new way to raise capital and coordinate initiatives for the world's most important social and environmental issues.
+
+## What is an action?
+
+A community project with predefined funding requirements. Initiatives are the mechanisms for how movements fund & monitor real world projects. Learn more about initiatives in the [communities section]().&#x20;
+
+## How are movements created?&#x20;
+
+First, before submitting a movement, you should rally support behind your movement. Movements have gas fees and require a 500 DAI tribute to submit (in order to disuade spam). They cannot be changed after submission and only have 30 days to reach their financing goal.&#x20;
+
+After a movement has been proposed backers can support the movement with DAI, $MOVE or ETH. If the movement raises enough funding supporter tokens are converted directly into the native movement token and distributed.&#x20;
+
+## **How does movement governance work?**&#x20;
+
+The community token holders and movement leaders govern the project. Because Movement DAO holds a large number of tokens, the Movement DAO collective is able to vote on individual movement initiative.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO also has veto powers on any movements or initiatives that break the community guidelines.&#x20;

+# Token Release
+
+## How does the token launch work?&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO is minting tokens directly from the bonding curve.&#x20;
+
+1. Tokens are released for presale in early January. They are availible for presale until January 30th.&#x20;
+2. Tokens purchased during the presale will be priced according to a linear bonding curve.&#x20;
+3. The exact bonding curve specifications will be voted on in discord.&#x20;
+4. Tokens will be distributed via a Merkal Airdrop.&#x20;
+5. The community will have 72 hours to review the airdrop list before tokens are distributed.&#x20;
+6. Tokens will be distributed on February 2nd at 2:22pm EST.&#x20;
+7. Token purchased in the presale will never expire.&#x20;
+
+## How are my total tokens calculated?&#x20;
+
+Tokens will be priced in accordance with a linear bonding curve.&#x20;
+
+It is possible that presale tokens will be subject to partial vesting in order to discourage pump and dump activity. Any vesting will be transparent and voted on by the community in discord beforehand.&#x20;
+
+## How do I receive my purchased tokens?&#x20;
+
+* Merkal airdrop website&#x20;
+* Just hookup your wallet, pay gas, and press claim!&#x20;
+
+
+
+## When do I receive my tokens?&#x20;
+
+February 2nd, 2:22pm EST, 2022.
+
+## How do I know the token launch is fair?&#x20;
+
+The community will have 72 hours to audit the token airdrop list before it is released.&#x20;
+
+[Learn more](#how-do-i-know-the-token-launch-is-fair).&#x20;
+
+## Token Allocation
+
+Galt seeded Movement DAO with owning 20% of all tokens. Galt answer to no investors, venture capitalists or special interest groups. Galt hope that the market value of these tokens represents a multiple above the original purchase price. These tokens provide Movement DAO with a large capital reserve to fund its ecosystem.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO commits to:
+
+* Minimum 5% of all tokens go towards movements.
+* Minimum 5% of tokens are to fund product development. &#x20;
+* Minimum 5% of all tokens are to compensate community members.&#x20;
+
+Movements have complete discretion on how to deploy these tokens in persuit of these objectives.&#x20;
+
+![Token Breakdown](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5pXCi1sB4wpjzJuQ5gnE%2Fuploads%2FFKZm2djc8Z4wFB5mzf7e%2FFrame%20344574.png?alt=media\&token=cf9cfb05-6a08-49ee-bae4-b21e297b5709)
+
+An important note, the locked LP tokens are owned by John Galt in reward for developing the system.&#x20;
+
+Finally, token distribution and funding amounts are subject to change at the communities discretion.&#x20;
+
+## How is the code released?&#x20;
+
+The codebase is released in three stages in order to optimize security, usability and decentralization (in that order).&#x20;
+
+**Stage One, Code Public for Audit (Presale release - 02/02/2022)**
+
+Code status:&#x20;
+
+* Backend code is released [open source](../../for-developers/repositories)&#x20;
+* Frontend code lives on IPFS&#x20;
+* Contracts live on [test-net](../../for-developers/smart-contracts#rinkeby) for developers&#x20;
+* Contracts live on [Main-net](../../for-developers/smart-contracts)&#x20;
+* Minor reliance on select server functions&#x20;
+
+**Stage Two, All Systems Live (02/02/2022 - TBD)**&#x20;
+
+Code status:&#x20;
+
+* Staking contracts added &#x20;
+* Code updated per [security audit](../../for-developers/security-audits) work&#x20;
+* All server functionality moved to smart contracts&#x20;
+* Minor reliance on select centralized databases (Github Gist's)&#x20;
+
+**Stage Three, 100% Decentralized (TBD - forever)**
+
+Code status:&#x20;
+
+* Remove all reliance on any databases that are not 100% decentralized&#x20;
